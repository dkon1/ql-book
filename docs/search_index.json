Nothing but mirrors and tides. – Anne Michaels, Fugitive Pieces This is an online book to help biologists and biology-adjacent folks learn quantitative skills through the practice of programming in R. These skills can be roughly sorted into four types: Building models and understanding assumptions Writing code to perform computational tasks Performing mathematical analysis of models Working with data and using statistical tools These skills interface, intertwine, and reinforce each other in the practice of biological research and are thus presented concurrently in this book, instead of being corralled into separate courses taught by different departments, like mathematics, statistics, and computer science. Here I combine ideas and skills from all of these disciplines into an educational narrative organized by increasing exposure to programming concepts. 1.1 A brief motivation of mathematical modeling A mathematical model is a representation of some real object or phenomenon in terms of quantities (numbers). The goal of modeling is to create a description of the object in question that may be used to pose and answer questions about it, without doing hard experimental work. A good analogy for a mathematical model is a map of a geographic area: a map cannot record all of the complexity of the actual piece of land, because then the map would need to be size of the piece of land, and then it wouldn’t be very useful! Maps, and mathematical models, need to sacrifice the details and provide a birds-eye view of reality in order to guide the traveler or the scientist. The representation of reality in the model must be simple enough to be useful, yet complex enough to capture the essential features of what it is trying to represent. Mathematical modeling has long been essential in physics: for instance, it is well known that distance traveled by an object traveling at constant speed \\(v\\) is proportional to the time traveled (called \\(t\\)). This mathematical model can be expressed as an equation: %\\[d = vt\\] Since the time of Newton, physicists have been very successful at using mathematics to describe the behavior of matter of all sizes, ranging from subatomic particles to galaxies. However, mathematical modeling is a new arrow in a biologist’s quiver. Many biologists would argue that living systems are much more complex than either atoms or galaxies, since even a single cell is made up of a mind-boggling number of highly dynamic, interacting entities. That is true, but new advances in experimental biology are producing data that make quantitative methods indispensable for biology. The advent of genetic sequencing in the 1970s and 80s has allowed us to determine the genomes of different species, and in the last few years next-generation sequencing has reduced sequencing costs for an individual human genome to a few thousand dollars. The resulting deluge of quantitative data has answered many outstanding questions, and also led to entirely new ones. We now understand that knowledge of genomic sequences is not enough for understanding how living things work, so the burgeoning field of systems biology investigates the interactions between genes, proteins, or other entities. The central question is to understand how a network of interactions between individual molecules can lead to large-scale results, such as the development of a fertilized egg into a complex organism. The human mind is not suited for making correct intuitive judgements about networks comprised of thousands of actors. Addressing questions of this complexity requires quantitative modeling. 1.2 Purpose of this book This textbook is intended for a college-level course for biology and pre-medicine majors, or more established scientists interested in learning the applications of mathematical methods to biology. The book brings together concepts found in mathematics, computer science, and statistics courses to provide the student a collection of skills that are commonly used in biological research. The book has two overarching goals: one is to explain the quantitative language that often is a formidable barrier to understanding and critically evaluating research results in biological and medical sciences. The second is to teach students computational skills that they can use in their future research endeavors. The main premise of this approach is that computation is critical for understanding abstract mathematical ideas. These goals are distinct from those of traditional mathematics courses that emphasize rigor and abstraction. I strongly believe that understanding of mathematical concepts is not contingent on being able to prove all of the underlying theorems. Instead, premature focus on abstraction obscures the ideas for most students; it is putting the theoretical cart before the experiential horse. I find that students can grasp deep concepts when they are allowed to experience them tangibly as numbers or pictures, and those with an abstract mindset can generalize and add rigor later. As I demonstrate in part 3 of the book, Markov chains can be explained without relying on the machinery of measure theory and stochastic processes, which require graduate level mathematical skills. The idea of a system randomly hopping between a few discrete states is far more accessible than sigma algebras and martingales. Of course, some abstraction is necessary when presenting mathematical ideas, and I provide correct definitions of terms and supply derivations when I find them to be illuminating. But I avoid rigorous proofs, and always favor understanding over mathematical precision. The book is structured to facilitate learning computational skills. Over the course of the text students accumulate programming experience, progressing from assigning values to variables in the first chapter to solving nonlinear ODEs numerically by the end of the book. Learning to program for the first time is a challenging task, and I facilitate it by providing sample scripts for students to copy and modify to perform the requisite calculations. Programming requires careful, methodical thinking, which facilitates deeper understanding of the models being simulated. In my experience of teaching this course, students consistently report that learning basic scientific programming is a rewarding experience, which opens doors for them in future research and learning. It is of course impossible to span the breadth of mathematics and computation used for modeling biological scenarios. This did not stop me from trying. The book is broad but selective, sticking to a few key concepts and examples which should provide enough of a basis for a student to go and explore a topic in more depth. For instance, I do not go through the usual menagerie of probability distributions in chapter 4, but only analyze the uniform and the binomial distributions. If one understands the concepts of distributions and their means and variances, it is not difficult to read up on the geometric or gamma distribution if one encounters it. Still, I omitted numerous topics and entire fields, some because they require greater mathematical sophistication, and others because they are too difficult for beginning programmers, e.g. sequence alignment and optimization algorithms. I hope that you do not end your quantitative journey with this book! I take an even more selective approach to the biological topics that I present in every chapter. The book is not intended to teach biology, but I do introduce biological questions I find interesting, refer the reader to current research papers, and provide discussion questions for you to wrestle with. This requires a basic explanation of terms and ideas, so most chapters contain a broad brushstrokes summary of a biological field, e.g. measuring mutation rates, epidemiology modeling, hidden Markov models for gene structure, and limitations of medical testing. I hope the experts in these fields forgive my omitting the interesting details that they spend their lives investigating, and trust that I managed to get the basic ideas across without gross distortion. 1.3 Organization of the book A course based on this textbook can be tailored to fit the quantitative needs of a biological sciences curriculum. At the University of Chicago the course I teach has replaced the last quarter of calculus as a first-year requirement for biology majors. This material could be used for a course without a calculus pre-requisite that a student takes before more rigorous statistics, mathematics, or computer science courses. It may also be taught as an upper-level elective course for students with greater maturity who may be ready to tackle the eigenvalues and differential equations chapters. My hope is that it may also prove useful for graduate students or established scientists who need an elementary but comprehensive introduction to the concepts they encounter in the literature or that they can use in their own research. Whatever path you traveled to get here, I wish you a fruitful journey through biomathematics and computation! "],
["arithmetic-and-variables-the-lifeblood-of-modeling.html", "2 Arithmetic and variables: the lifeblood of modeling 2.1 Blood circulation and mathematical modeling 2.2 Parameters and variables in models", " 2 Arithmetic and variables: the lifeblood of modeling You can add up the parts, but you won’t have the sum; You can strike up the march, there is no drum. Every heart, every heart to love will come But like a refugee. – Leonard Cohen, Anthem Mathematical modeling begins with a set of assumptions. In fact, one may say that a mathematical model is a bunch of assumptions translated into mathematics. These assumptions may be more or less reasonable, and they may come from different sources. For instance, many physical models are so well-established that we refer to them as laws; we are pretty sure they apply to molecules, cells, and organisms as well as to inanimate objects. Thus we may use physical laws as the foundation on which to build models of biological entities; these are often known as first-principles (theory-based) models. Other times we have experimental evidence which suggests a certain kind of relationship between quantities, perhaps we find that the amount of administered drug and the time until the drug is completely removed from the bloodstream are proportional to each other. This observation can be turned into an empirical (experiment-based) model. Yet another type of model assumption is not based on either theory or experiment, but simply on convenience: e.g. let us assume that the mutation rates in two different loci are independent, and see what the implications are. These are sometimes called toy or cartoon models. This leads to the question: how do you decide whether a model is good? It is surprisingly difficult to give a straightforward answer to this question. Of course, one major goal of a model is to capture some essential features of reality, so in most biological modeling studies you will see a comparison between experimental results and predictions of the model. But it is not enough for a model to be faithful to experimental data! Think of a simple example: suppose your experiment produced 5 data points as a function of time; it is possible to find a polynomial (of fourth degree) that passes exactly through all 5 points, by specifying the coefficients of its 5 terms. This is called data fitting and it has a large role to play in mathematical modeling of biology. However, I think you will agree that in this case we have learned very little: we just substituted 5 values in the data set with 5 values of the coefficients of the mathematical model. To heighten the absurdity, imagine a data set of 1001 points that you have modeled using a 1000-degree polynomial. This is an example of overfitting, or making the model agree with the data by making it overly complex. Substituting a complicated model for a complicated real situation does not help understand it. One necessary ingredient of a useful model is simplicity of assumptions. Simplicity in modeling has at least two virtues: simple models can be grasped by our limited minds, and simple assumptions can be tested against evidence. A simple model that fails to reproduce experimental data can be more informative than a complex model that fits the data perfectly. If a simple model fails, you have learned that you are missing something in your assumptions; but a complex model can be right for the wrong reasons, like erroneous assumptions canceling each other, or it may contain needless assumptions. This is why good modeling is a difficult skill that balances simplicity of assumptions against fidelity to empirical data . In this chapter you will learn how to do the following: distinguish variables and parameters in models describe the state space of a model perform arithmetic operations in R assign variables in R 2.1 Blood circulation and mathematical modeling Galen was one of the great physicians of antiquity. He studied how the body works by performing experiments on humans and animals. Among other things, he was famous for a careful study of the heart and how blood traveled through the body. Galen observed that there were different types of blood: arterial blood that flowed out of the heart, which was bright red, and venous blood that flowed in the opposite direction, which was a darker color. This naturally led to questions: what is the difference between venous and arterial blood? where does each one come from and where does it go? You, a reader of the 21st century, likely already know the answer: blood circulates through the body, bringing oxygen and nutrients to the tissues through the arteries, and returns back through the veins carrying carbon dioxide and waste products, as shown in figure . Arterial blood contains a lot of oxygen while venous blood carries more carbon dioxide, but otherwise they are the same fluid. The heart does the physical work of pushing arterial blood out of the heart, to the tissues and organs, as well as pushing venous blood through the second circulatory loop that goes through the lungs, where it picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide, becoming arterial blood again. This may seem like a very natural picture to you, but it is far from easy to deduce by simple observation. Human blood circulates throughout the body and returns to the heart, veins shown in blue and arteries in red. Circulatory System en by LadyofHats in public domain via Wikimedia Commons. 2.1.1 Galen’s theory of blood Galen came up with a different explanation based on the notion of humors, or fluids, that was fundamental to the Greek conception of the body. He proposed that the venous and arterial blood were different humors: venous blood, or natural spirits, was produced by the liver, while arterial blood, or vital spirits, was produced by the heart and carried by the arteries, as shown in figure . The heart consisted of two halves, and it warmed the blood and pushed both the natural and vital spirits out to the organs; the two spirits could mix through pores in the septum separating its right and left halves. The vital and natural spirits were both consumed by the organs, and regenerated by the liver and the heart. The purpose of the lungs was to serve as bellows, cooling the blood after it was heated by the heart. Illustration of Galen’s conception of the blood system, showing different spirits traveling in one direction, but not circulating. Reproduced by permission courtesy of Dr. Barbara Becker. Is this a good theory of how the heart, lungs, and blood work? Doctors in Europe thought so for over one thousand years! Galen’s textbook on physiology was the standard for medical students through the 17th century. The theory seemed to make sense, and explain what was observable. Many great scientists and physicians, including Leonardo DaVinci and Avicenna, did not challenge the inaccuracies such as the porous septum in the heart, even though they could not see the pores themselves. It took both better observations and a quantitative testing of the hypothesis to challenge the orthodoxy. 2.1.2 Mathematical testing of the theory William Harvey was born in England and studied medicine in Padua under the great physician Hieronymus Fabricius. He became famous, and would perform public demonstrations of physiology, using live animals for experiments that would not be approved today. He also studied the heart and the blood vessels, and measured the volume of the blood that can be contained in the human heart. He was quite accurate in estimating the correct volume, which we now know to be about 70 ml (1.5 oz). What is even more impressive is that he used this quantitative information to test Galen’s theory. Let us assume that all of the blood that is pumped out by the heart is consumed by the tissues, as Galen proposed; let us further assume that the heart beats at constant rate of 60 beats per minute, with a constant ejection volume of 70 ml. Then over the course of a day, the human body would consume about \\[\\mathrm{Volume} = 70 \\ \\mathrm {mL} \\times 60 \\ \\mathrm {(beats \\ per \\ minute)} \\times 60 \\ \\mathrm {(minutes \\ per \\ hour)} \\times 24 \\ \\mathrm {(hours \\ per \\ day)}\\] or over 6,000 liters of blood! You may quibble over the exact numbers (some hearts beat faster or slower, some hearts may be larger or smaller) but the impact of the calculation remains the same: it is an absurd conclusion. Galen’s theory would require the human being to consume and produce a quantity of fluid many times the volume of the human body (about 100 liters) in a day! This is a physical impossibility, so the only possible conclusion in that Galen’s model is wrong. This led Harvey to propose the model that we know today: that blood is not consumed by the tissues, but instead returns to the heart and is re-used again . This is why we call the heart and blood vessels part of the circulatory system of the body. This model was controversial at the time - some people proclaimed they would ``rather be wrong with Galen, than right with Harvey’’ - but eventually became accepted as the standard model. What is remarkable is that Harvey’s argument, despite being grounded in empirical data, was strictly mathematical. He adopted the assumptions of Galen, made the calculations, and got a result which was inconsistent with reality. This is an excellent example of how mathematical modeling can be useful, because it can provide clear evidence against a wrong hypothesis. 2.2 Parameters and variables in models Many biologists remain skeptical of mathematical modeling. The criticism can be summarized like this: a theoretical model either agrees with experiment, or it does not. In the former case, it is useless, because the data are already known; in the latter case, it is wrong! As I indicated above, the goal of mathematical modeling is not to reproduce experimental data; otherwise, indeed, it would only be of interest to theoreticians. The correct question to ask is, does a theoretical model help us understand the real thing? There are at least three ways in which a model can be useful: A model can help a scientist make sense of complex data, by testing whether a particular mechanism explains the observations. Thus, a model can help clarify our understanding by throwing away the non-essential features and focusing on the most important ones. A mathematical model makes predictions for situations that have not been observed. It is easy to change parameters in a mathematical model and calculate the effects. This can lead to new hypotheses that can be tested by experiments. Model predictions can lead to better experimental design. Instead of trying a whole bunch of conditions, the theoretical model can suggest which ones will produce big effects, and thus can save a lot of work for the lab scientist. In order to make a useful model of a complex living system, you have to simplify it. Even if you are only interested in a part of it, for instance a cell or a single molecule, you have to make simplifying choices. A small protein has thousands of atoms, a cell consists of millions of molecules, which all interact with each other; keeping track mathematically of every single component is daunting if not impossible. To build a useful mathematical model one must choose a few quantities which describe the system sufficiently to answer the questions of interest. For instance, if the positions of a couple of atoms in the protein you are studying determine its activity, those positions would make natural quantities to include in your model. You will find more specific examples of models later in this chapter. Once you have decided on the essential quantities to be included in the model, these are divided into variables and parameters. As suggested by the name, a variable typically varies over time and the model tracks the changes in its value, while parameters usually stay constant, or change more slowly. However, that is not always the case. The most important difference is that variables describe quantities within the system being modeled, while parameters usually refer to quantities which are controlled by something outside the system. As you can see from this definition, the same quantity can be a variable or a parameter depending on the scope of the model. Let’s go back to our example of modeling a protein: usually the activity (and the structure) of a protein is influenced by external conditions such as pH and temperature; these would be natural parameters for a model of the molecule. However, if we model an entire organism, the pH (e.g. of the blood plasma) and temperature are controlled by physiological processes within the organism, and thus these quantities will now be considered variables. Perhaps the clearest way to differentiate between variables and parameters is to think about how you would present a data set visually. We will discuss plotting graphs of functions in chapter 2, and plotting data sets in chapter 3, but the reader has likely seen many such plots before. Consider which of the quantities you would to plot to describe the system you are modeling. If the quantity belongs on either axis, it is a variable, since it is important to describe how it changes. The rest of the quantities can be called parameters. Of course, depending on the question you ask, the same quantity may be plotted on an axis or not, which is why this classification is not absolute. After we have specified the essential variables for your model, we can describe a complex and evolving biological system in terms of its state. This is a very general term, but it usually means the values of all the variables that you have chosen for the model, which are often called state variables. For instance, an ion channel can be described with the state variable of conformation, which may be in a open state or in a closed state. The range, or collection of all different states of the system is called the state space of the model. Below you will find examples of models of biological systems with diverse state spaces. 2.2.1 discrete state variables: genetics There are genes which are present in a population as two different versions, called *alleles} - let us use letters \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) to label them. One may describe the genetic state of an individual based on which allele it carries. If this individual is haploid, e.g. a bacterium, then it only carries a single copy of the genome, and its state can be described by a single variable with the state space of \\(A\\) or \\(B\\). A diploid organism, like a human, possesses two copies of each gene (unless it is on one of the sex chromosomes, X or Y); each copy may be in either state \\(A\\) or \\(B\\). This may seem to suggest that there are four different values in the genetic state space, but if the order of the copies does not matter (which is usually the case), then \\(AB\\) and \\(BA\\) are effectively the same, so the state space consists of three values: \\(AA\\), \\(BB\\), and \\(AB\\). 2.2.2 discrete state variables: population Consider the model of a population of individuals, with the variable of number of individuals (populations size) and parameters being the birth and death rates. The state space of this model is all integers between 0 and infinity. Consider the model of a population of individuals who may get infected. Assume that the total number of individuals does not change (that is, there are no births and deaths) and that these individuals can be in one of two states: healthy or sick (in epidemiology these are called susceptible or infectious). There are typically two parameters in such models: the probability of infection and the probability of recovery. Since the total population is fixed at some number \\(N\\), the space space of the model is all pairs of integers between 0 and \\(N\\) that add up to \\(N\\). 2.2.3 continuous state variables: concentration Suppose that a biological molecule is produced with a certain rate and degraded with a different rate, and we would like to describe the quantity of the molecule, usually expressed as concentration. The relevant variables here are concentration and time, and you will see those variables on the axes of many plots in biochemistry. Concentration is a ratio of the number of molecules and the volume, so the state space can be any positive real number (although practically there is a limit as to how many molecules can fit inside a given volume, but for simplicity we can ignore this). Going even further, let us consider an entire cell, which contains a large number of different molecules. We can describe the state of a cell as the collection of all the molecular concentrations, with the parameters being the rates of all the reactions going on between those molecules. The state space for this model with \\(N\\) different molecules is \\(N\\) positive real numbers. "],
["functions-and-their-graphs.html", "3 Functions and their graphs 3.1 Dimensions of quantities 3.2 Functions and their graphs", " 3 Functions and their graphs Some fathers, if you ask them for the time of day, spit silver dollars. Donald Barthelme, The Dead Father Mathematical models describe how various quantities affect each other. In the last chapter we learned that these descriptions can be written down, often in the form of an equation. For instance, we can describe the total volume of blood pumped over a period of time as the product of stroke volume, the heart rate and the number of minutes, which can be written as an equation. The different quantities have their own meaning and roles, depending on what they stand for. To better describe how these quantities are related we use the deep idea of mathematical functions. In this chapter you will learn to do the following: use dimensional analysis to deduce the meaning of quantities in a model understand the concept of function, dependent and independent variables recognize basic functional forms and the shape of their graphs use R to plot functions understand basic models of reaction rates 3.1 Dimensions of quantities What distinguishes a mathematical model from a mathematical equation is that the quantities involved have a real-world meaning. Each quantity represents a measurement, and associated with each one are the units of measurement. The number 173 is not enough to describe the height of a person - you are left to wonder 173 what? meters, centimeters, nanometers, light-years? Obviously, only centimeters make sense as a unit of measurement for human height; but if we were measuring the distance between two animals in a habitat, meters would be a reasonable unit, and it were the distance between molecules in a cell, we would use nanometers. Thus, any quantity in a mathematical model must have associated units, and any graphs of these quantities must be labeled accordingly. In addition to units, each variable and parameter has a meaning, which is called the dimension of the quantity. For example, any measurement of length or distance has the same dimension, although the units may vary. The value of a quantity depends on the units of measurement, but its essential dimensionality does not. One can convert a measurement in meters to that in light-years or cubits, but one cannot convert a measurement in number of sheep to seconds - that conversion has no meaning. Thus leads us to the fundamental rule of mathematical modeling: terms that are added or subtracted must have the same dimension. This gives mathematical modelers a useful tool called dimensional analysis, which involves replacing the quantities in an equation with their dimensions. This serves as a check that all dimensions match, as well as allowing to deduce the dimensions of any parameters for which the dimension was not specified. Example. As we saw in chapter 1, the relationship between the amount blood pumped by a heart in a certain amount of time is expressed in the following equation, where \\(V_{tot}\\) and \\(V_s\\) are the total volume and stroke volume, respectively, \\(R\\) is the heart rate, and \\(t\\) is the time: \\[ V_{tot} = V_sRt \\] The dimension of a quantity \\(X\\) is denoted by \\([X]\\); for example, if \\(t\\) has the dimension of time, we write \\([t] = time\\). The dimension of volume is \\([V_{tot}] = length^3\\), the dimension of stroke volume is \\([V_s] = volume/beat\\) and the dimension of time \\(t\\) is time, so we can re-write the equation above in dimensional form: \\[length^3 = length^3/ beat \\times R \\times time\\] Solving this equation for R, we find that it must have the dimensions of \\([R] = beats/time\\). It can be measured in beats per minute (typical for heart rate), or beats per second, beats per hour, etc. but the dimensionality of the quantity cannot be changed without making the model meaningless. There are also dimensionless quantities, or pure numbers, which are not tied to a physical meaning at all. Fundamental mathematical constants, like \\(\\pi\\) or \\(e\\), are classic examples, as are some important quantities in physics, like the Reynolds number in fluid mechanics. Quantities with a dimension can be made dimensionless by dividing them by another quantity with the same dimension and “canceling” the dimensions. For instance, we can express the height of a person as a fraction of the mean height of the population; then the height of a tall person will become a number greater than 1, and the height of a short one will become less than 1. This new dimensionless height does not have units of length - they have been divided out by the mean height. This is known as rescaling the quantity, by dividing it by a preferred scale. There is a fundamental difference between rescaling and changing the units of a quantity: when changing the units, e.g. from inches to centimeters, the dimension remains the same, but if one divides the quantity by a scale, it loses its dimension. Example. The model for a population of bacteria that doubles every hour is described by the equation, where \\(P_0\\) is initial number of bacteria and \\(P\\) is the population after \\(t\\) hours: \\[ P = P_0 2^t \\] Let us define the quantity \\(R=P/P_0\\), so we can say that population increased by a factor of \\(R\\) after \\(t\\) hours. This ratio is a dimensionless quantity because \\(P\\) and \\(P_0\\) have the same dimension of bacterial population, which cancel out. The equation for \\(R\\) can be written as follows: \\[ R= 2^t \\] According to dimensional analysis, both sides of the equation have to be dimensionless, so \\(t\\) must also be a dimensionless variable. This is surprising, because \\(t\\) indicates the number of hours the bacterial colony has been growing. This reveals the subtle fact that \\(t\\) is a rescaled variable obtained by dividing the elapsed time by the length of the reproductive cycle. Because of the assumption that the bacteria divide exactly once an hour, \\(t\\) counts the number of hours, but if they divided once a day, \\(t\\) would denote the number of days. So \\(t\\) doesn’t have units or dimensions, but instead denotes the dimensionless number of cell divisions. 3.1.1 Exercises For each biological model below determine the dimensions of the parameters, based on the given dimensions of the variables. Model of number of mutations \\(M\\) as a function of time \\(t\\): \\[ M(t) = M_0 + \\mu t\\] Model of molecular concentration \\(C\\) as a function of time \\(t\\): \\[ C(t) = C_0 e^{-kt} \\] Model of tree height \\(H\\) (length) as a function of age \\(a\\) (time): \\[ H(a) = \\frac{b a}{c + a}\\] Model of cooperative binding of ligands, with fraction of bound receptors \\(\\theta\\) as a function of ligand concentration \\(L\\): \\[ \\theta (L) = \\frac{L^n}{L^n + K_d}\\] Model of concentration of a gene product \\(G\\) (concentration) as a function of time \\(t\\): \\[ G(t) = G_m (1 - e^{-\\alpha t})\\] Michaelis-Menten model of enzyme kinetics, \\(v\\) is reaction rate (1/time) and \\(S\\) is substrate concentration: \\[ v(S) = \\frac{v_{max} S}{K_m + S}\\] Logistic model of population growth, \\(P\\) is population size and time \\(t\\): \\[ P(t) = \\frac{A e^{kt}}{1 + B(e^{kt} -1)} \\] 3.2 Functions and their graphs A relationship between two variables addresses the basic question: when one variable changes, how does this affect the other? An equation, like the examples in the last section, allows one to calculate the value of one variable based on the other variable and parameter values. In this section we seek to describe more broadly how two variables are related by using the mathematical concept of functions. Definition: A function is a mathematical rule which has an input and an output. A function returns a well-defined output for every input, that is, for a given input value the function returns a unique output value. In this abstract definition of a function it doesn’t have to be written as an algebraic equation, it only has to return a unique output for any given input value. In mathematics we usually write them down in terms of algebraic expressions. As in mathematical models, you will see two different kinds of quantities in equations that define functions: variables and parameters. The input and the output of a function are usually variables, with the input called the independent variable and the output called the dependent variable. The relationship between the input and the output can be graphically illustrated in a graph, which is a collection of paired values of the independent and dependent variable drawn as a curve in the plane. Although it shows how the two variables change relative to each other, parameters may change too, which results in a different graph of the function. While graphing calculators and computers can draw graphs for you, it is very helpful to have an intuitive understanding about how a function behaves, and how the behavior depends on the parameters. Here are the three questions to help picture the relationship (assume \\(x\\) is the independent variable and it is a nonnegative real number): what is the value of the function at \\(x=0\\)? what does the function do when \\(x\\) becomes large (\\(x \\to \\infty\\))? what does the function do between the two extremes? Below you will find examples of fundamental functions used in biological models with descriptions of how their parameters influence their graphs. 3.2.1 linear and exponential functions The reader is probably familiar with linear and exponential functions from algebra courses. However, they are so commonly used that it is worth going over them to refresh your memory and perhaps to see them from another perspective. Definition A linear function \\(f(x)\\) is one for which the difference in two function values is the same for a specific difference in the independent variable. In mathematical terms, this can be written an equation for any two values of the independent variable \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) and a difference \\(\\Delta x\\): \\[ f(x_1 + \\Delta x) - f(x_1) = f(x_2 + \\Delta x) - f(x_2) \\] The general form of the linear function is written as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} f(x) = ax + b \\label{eq:linear_funk} \\end{equation}\\] The function contains two parameters: the slope \\(a\\) and the y-intercept \\(b\\). The graph of the linear function is a line (hence the name) and the slope \\(a\\) determines its steepness. A positive slope corresponds to the graph that increases as \\(x\\) increases, and a negative slope corresponds to a declining function. At \\(x=0\\), the function equals \\(b\\), and as \\(x \\to \\infty\\), the function approaches positive infinity if \\(a&gt;0\\), and approaches negative infinity if \\(a&lt;0\\). Definition An exponential function \\(f(x)\\) is one for which the ratio of two function values is the same for a specific difference in the independent variable. Mathematically speaking, this can be written as follows for any two values of the independent variable \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) and a difference \\(\\Delta x\\): \\[ \\frac{f(x_1 + \\Delta x)}{f(x_1)} = \\frac{f(x_2 + \\Delta x)}{f(x_2)}\\] Exponential functions can be written using different symbolic forms, but they all have a constant base with the variable \\(x\\) in the exponent. I prefer to use the constant \\(e\\) (base of the natural logarithm) as the base of all the exponential functions, for reasons that will become apparent in chapter 15. This does not restrict the range of possible functions, because any exponential function can be expressed using base \\(e\\), using a transformation: \\(a^x = e^{x \\ln(a)}\\). So let us agree to write exponential functions in the following form: \\[\\begin{equation} f(x) = a e^{rx} \\label{eq:exp_funk} \\end{equation}\\] The function contains two parameters: the \\(r\\) and the multiplicative constant \\(a\\). The graph of the exponential function is a curve which crosses the y-axis at \\(y=a\\) (plug in \\(x=0\\) to see that this is the case). As \\(x\\) increases, the behavior of the graph depends on the sign of the rate constant \\(r\\). If \\(r&gt;0\\), the function approaches infinity (positive if \\(a&gt;0\\), negative if \\(a&lt;0\\)) as \\(x \\to \\infty\\). If \\(r&lt;0\\), the function decays at an ever-decreasing pace and asymptotically approaches zero as \\(x \\to \\infty\\). Thus the graph of \\(f(x)\\) is a curve either going to infinity or a curve asymptotically approaching 0, and the steepness of the growth or decay is determined by \\(r\\). Figure 3.1: Plots of two linear functions (left) and two exponential functions (right). Can you identify which linear function has the positive slope and which one negative? Which exponential function has a positive rate constant and which one negative? 3.2.2 Exercises Answer the questions below, some of which refer to the function graphs in figure ??. Which of the linear graphs in the first figure corresponds to \\(f(x) = 5x\\) and which corresponds to \\(f(x) = 10-x\\)? State which parameter allows you to connect the function with its graph and explain why. Which of the exponential graphs in the second figure corresponds to \\(f(x) = 0.1e^{0.5x}\\) and which corresponds to \\(f(x) = 12e^{-0.2x}\\)? State which parameter allows you to connect the function with its graph and explain why. Demonstrate algebraically that a linear function of the form given in equation satisfies the property of linear functions from definition . Demonstrate algebraically that an exponential function of the form given in equation satisfies the property of exponential functions from definition . Modify the exponential function by adding a constant term to it \\(f(x) = a e^{rx} + b\\). What is is the value of this function at \\(x=0\\)? How does the function defined in the previous exercise, \\(f(x) = a e^{rx} + b\\), how does it behave as \\(x \\to \\infty\\) if \\(r&gt;0\\)? How does the function \\(f(x) = a e^{rx} + b\\) behave as \\(x \\to \\infty\\) if \\(r&lt;0\\)? 3.2.3 rational and logistic functions Let us now turn to more complex functions, made up of simpler components that we understand. Consider a ratio of two polynomials, called a . The general form of such functions can be written down as follows, where ellipsis stands for terms with powers lower than \\(n\\) or \\(m\\): \\[\\begin{equation} f(x) = \\frac{a_0 + ... + a_n x^n}{b_0 + ... + b_m x^m} \\label{eq:rational_funk} \\end{equation}\\] The two polynomials may have different degrees (highest power of the terms, \\(n\\) and \\(m\\)), but they are usually the same in most biological examples. The reason is that if the numerator and the denominator are ``unbalanced’’, one will inevitably overpower the other for large values of \\(x\\), which would lead to the function either increasing without bound to infinity (if \\(n&gt;m\\)) or decaying to zero (if \\(m&gt;n\\)). There’s nothing wrong with that, mathematically, but rational functions are most frequently used to model quantities that approach a nonzero asymptote for large values of the independent variable. For this reason, let us assume \\(m=n\\) and consider what happens as \\(x \\to \\infty\\). All terms other than the highest-order terms become very small in comparison to \\(x^n\\) (this is something you can demonstrate to yourself using R), and thus both the numerator and the denominator approach the terms with power \\(n\\). This can be written using the mathematical limit notation \\(\\lim_{x \\to \\infty}\\) which describes the value that a function approaches when the independent variable increases without bound: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{a_0 + ... + a_n x^n}{b_0 + ... + b_n x^n} = \\frac{ a_n x^n}{ b_n x^n} = \\frac{ a_n}{ b_n} \\] Therefore, the function approaches the value of \\(a_n /b_n\\) as \\(x\\) grows. Similarly, let us consider what happens when \\(x=0\\). Plugging this into the function results in all of the terms vanishing except for the constant terms, so \\[ f(0) = \\frac{ a_0}{ b_0} \\] Between 0 and infinity, the function either increases or decreases monotonically, depending on which value (\\(a_n /b_n\\) or \\(a_0/b_0\\)) is greater. Two examples of plots of rational functions are shown in figure , which shows graphs increasing from 0 to 1. Depending on the degree of the polynomials in a rational function, it may increase more gradually (solid line) or more step-like (dashed line). The following model, called the , describes the fraction of receptor molecules which are bound to a ligand, which is a chemical term for a free molecule that binds to another, typically larger, receptor molecule. \\(\\theta\\) is the fraction of receptors bound to a ligand, \\(L\\) denotes the ligand concentration, \\(K_d\\) is the dissociation constant, and \\(n\\) called the or Hill coefficient: \\[ \\theta = \\frac{L^n}{ L^n +K_d}\\] The Hill equation is a rational function, and Figure shows plots of the graphs of two such function in the right panel. This model is further explored in exercise 2.2.10. A common model of population over time is the . There are variations on how it is written down, but here is one general form: \\[\\begin{equation} f(x) = \\frac{a e^{rx} }{b+e^{rx}} \\label{eq:logistic_funk} \\end{equation}\\] The numerator and denominator both contain exponential functions with the same power. If \\(r&gt;0\\) when \\(x \\to \\infty\\), the denominator approaches \\(e^{rx}\\), since it becomes much greater than \\(b\\), and we can calculate: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} = \\frac{a e^{rx} }{e^{rx}} = a; \\; \\mathrm{if} \\; r&gt;0 \\] On the other hand, if \\(r&lt;0\\), then the numerator approaches zero as \\(x \\to \\infty\\), and so does the function \\[ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} = \\frac{0}{b} = 0; \\; \\mathrm{if} \\; r&lt;0 \\] Notice that switching the sign of \\(r\\) has the same effect as switching the sign of \\(x\\), since they are multiplied. Which means that for positive \\(r\\), if \\(x\\) is extended to negative infinity, the function approaches 0. This is illustrated in the second plot in Figure , which shows two logistic functions increasing from 0 to a positive level, one with \\(a=20\\) (solid line) and the second with \\(a=10\\) (dashed line). The graph of logistic functions has a characteristic ``sigmoidal’’ (S-shaped) shape, and its steepness is determined by the rate \\(r\\): if \\(r\\) is small, the curve is soft, if \\(r\\) is large, the graph resembles a step function.
